##A small program using NLTK  and PyPDF2 to read pdfs and see the Zipf's law in action. 
Zipf's law is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. 
Zipf distribution is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical. Here the distribution is of words in the pdf used.
